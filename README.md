# Runic n-grams

This is a relatively simple script and web app to generate n-grams within strings of futhark characters. It collates n-grams, or rather n-graphs,
yielding a results table indicating how often specific runes occur together.
This script was specifically written for the work of Dr. Elisabeth Magin. It works only with Dr. Magins system for variation sensitive encoding of 
futhark characters.

## Runing the app

There are two ways of running this application. You can either refer to the instance of the web app hosted in the Streamlit Community Cloud at the link here:
